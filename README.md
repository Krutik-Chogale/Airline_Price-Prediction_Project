# Airline_Price-Prediction_Project
## Goal of this Project:
#### This Project contains the dataset for flight data. The goal is to predict to the correct flight price based on the variables that you think are the right ones to make the prediction. The model's performance will be evaluated based on its ability to minimize the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the model's predicted values and the actual flight prices.

#### The dataset is in CSV format, which consists of various features related to flight prices, such as departure city, destination city, date and time of flight, flight duration, airline, etc. Your mission is to extract valuable insights from this data and create a model that can predict flight prices as accurately as possible.

## Overview
The data has been split into two groups:
  1.train set (train.csv)
  2.test set (test.csv)
  
#### The train set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “Flight_Price ”) for each flight.

#### The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the fare for each flight. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each flight in the test set, use the model you trained to predict the price of the flight ticket.
